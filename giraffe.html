         <h3>GIRAFFES</h3>
         <P>Giraffes (genus Giraffa) are African artiodactyl mammals. They are the tallest living terrestrial animals and the largest ruminants. Traditionally they are thought to comprise one species, Giraffa camelopardalis, with nine subspecies. However, the existence of up to nine extant giraffe species has been described, based upon research into the mitochondrial and nuclear DNA, as well as morphological measurements of Giraffa. Seven other prehistoric species, known from fossils, are extinct.</P>
         <P>Giraffes' chief distinguishing characteristics are their extremely long neck and legs, their horn-like ossicones, and their distinctive coat patterns. They are classified under the family Giraffidae, along with their closest extant relative, the okapi. Their scattered range extends from Chad in the north to South Africa in the south, and from Niger in the west to Somalia in the east. Giraffes usually inhabit savannahs and woodlands. Their food source is leaves, fruits and flowers of woody plants, primarily acacia species, which they browse at heights most other herbivores cannot reach.</P>
         <p>Lions, leopards, spotted hyenas and African wild dogs may prey upon giraffes. Giraffes live in herds of related females and their offspring, or bachelor herds of unrelated adult males, but are gregarious and may gather in large aggregations. Males establish social hierarchies through "necking", which are combat bouts where the neck is used as a weapon. Dominant males gain mating access to females, which bear the sole responsibility for raising the young.</p>
         <P>Giraffes have intrigued various ancient and modern cultures for their peculiar appearance, and have often been featured in paintings, books, and cartoons. They are classified by the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN) as vulnerable to extinction and has been extirpated from many parts of its former range. Giraffes are still found in numerous national parks and game reserves, but estimates as of 2016 indicate there are approximately 97,500 members of Giraffa in the wild. More than 1,600 were kept in zoos in 2010.</P>
